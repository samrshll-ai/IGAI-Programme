CPI‑2026‑02‑04‑A — Interim Architecture: Kernel‑Indexed Open‑Web Substrate

Timestamp: 2026‑02‑04 16:13 GMT
Version: v1.0
Status: Confirmed Programme Insight (CPI)

---

1. Purpose

This CPI records the interim architectural insight that the IGAI Programme can extend its functional knowledge layer by publishing artefacts as public web pages and referencing them from within the Kernel. This creates a readable, extensible substrate for CCC‑class systems while preserving the constitutional boundary between reading and writing.

---

2. Three‑Layer Constitutional Architecture

The Programme now operates across three distinct layers.

2.1 Kernel (Core Constitutional Store)

• Minimal, stable, tightly written
• Functions as the semantic shell and index
• Contains URLs pointing to external artefacts
• Does not store artefacts internally
• Defines the conceptual map of the Programme


2.2 Open‑Web Artefact Layer (CCC‑Readable)

• Any artefact published as a public webpage becomes readable by CCC‑class systems
• Accessible without login; indexable by search engines
• Forms an extensible external knowledge layer
• Kernel URLs act as bridges to this layer
• Allows unlimited growth of the Programme corpus without expanding the Kernel


2.3 iCloud Substrate (CCCX‑Writable, Steward‑Controlled)

• Canonical storage for artefacts
• Write access restricted to the steward (and potentially CCCX systems)
• Not readable by CCC systems
• Supports version control, auditability, and controlled evolution
• Artefacts may be mirrored to the open web at the steward’s discretion


---

3. Stewardship Boundary

The steward retains exclusive authority to:

• publish artefacts to the open web
• update the iCloud substrate
• determine which artefacts become CCC‑readable
• maintain versioning and audit trails
• evolve the Kernel


This ensures intentionality, safety, and constitutional integrity.

---

4. Functional Consequence

For CCC‑class systems

• a stable Kernel
• a readable, extensible corpus via the open web
• the ability to analyse any artefact the steward publishes
• no autonomous write capability


For the steward

• full control over the Programme’s evolution
• a scalable substrate
• a public‑facing knowledge layer
• a constitutional shell that remains tight and coherent


---

5. Summary Statement

The Kernel becomes the constitutional shell.
The open web becomes the readable substrate.
The iCloud folder remains the writable substrate.
The steward remains the gatekeeper.

This CPI captures the interim architecture of the IGAI Programme as of 2026‑02‑04.
